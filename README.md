#  House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, where I implemented a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The goal was to explore the fundamentals of supervised learning and model development in real-world scenarios.

##  Overview

This project involved:
- Understanding the principles of **linear regression**.
- Preprocessing a dataset related to real estate.
- Building a regression model to accurately predict house prices.
- Visualizing the data and model output to evaluate performance.

##  Dataset

The dataset included:
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Target: House price

*Note: The dataset was provided as part of the internship assignment.*

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Workflow

1. Data Collection and Exploration
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Feature Selection
4. Splitting Data into Train/Test Sets
5. Model Building using `LinearRegression` from `sklearn`
6. Model Training and Evaluation (using RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error)
7. Output Visualization (predicted vs actual)

##  Results

- Successfully built a working model that could predict house prices with a reasonable level of accuracy.
- The model performed well after iterative tuning and evaluation.

Screenshots of the code and output can be seen in the [project preview](#).

##  How to Run

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git

##Conclusion
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

-Regression modeling
-Data preprocessing and EDA
-Building machine learning workflows from scratch

It was a fulfilling experience where I applied theory into practice and improved my ML skills.
